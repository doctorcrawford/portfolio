    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born in NYC but raised just outside the city in a small town called Hastings on Hudson. I started to attend Binghamton University for engineering but decided my heart wasn't in it so I left to work for a bit to figure out what I really wanted my career to be. I moved to Boston for about a year working as a bartender there. Then booked a one-way ticket to Australia with a couple friends where we decided to live for a year, bartending there as well. Once our visas were up, we took the scenic route back home by exploring SE Asia for 6 months before finally landing back in the states. Once home, I started working at a local Parks & Rec Department where I ended up staying for the next 6 years running the town pool, summer camp, afterschool activities, sports programs and more. While I very much enjoyed my time there, I still felt a calling for something different so I started to look into coding. I found that a job in the tech world really interested me and I had always wanted to live on the west coast so I, again, booked a one-way ticket to PDX and enrolled in Epicodus to start my coding career.</p>
    <h5>Interests, Hobbies, Skills</h5>
    <p>I <strong>love</strong> the outdoors and everything that comes with it: hiking, camping, snowboarding, swimming, biking, running. I love playing most sports, but especially basketball. Being from NY I am also a huge Knicks fan. I have been a musician since I was a kid, with my primary instrument being the saxophone. I have produced a handful of tracks with a childhood friend under the alias <em>KNXN</em> (<em>pronounced connection</em>), some of which you can find on <a href="https://linktr.ee/knxnmusic">our website</a>. I very much enjoy seeing live music, cooking, and meeting new people.</p>
